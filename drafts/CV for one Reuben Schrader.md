## About me
I'm so great.

I've extended my background in the humanities and heritage to learn about development and the tech that makes things work. That combination makes me an excellent editor and content strategist for [a tech agency].

When I edit, I make sure the piece is a strong and personal expression by working closely with the author, and not just their text. I make sure they justify their assumptions, consider their audience, and speak with an authentic voice. Once their work is on the page, I make precise changes that ensure it reflects the best version of the author.

I've created processes and tools, from templates to workflows to web apps, to make producing great content easier. By embedding good practices throughout the organisation, I've improved our responsiveness, our ability to coordinate, and our capacity.
